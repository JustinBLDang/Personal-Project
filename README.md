# Personal-Project
A little incomplete game that was initially inspired by This War of Mine and Fallout Shelter on the IOS.

This was my very first coding project which started in 2019. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to set small goals such as getting a character to move, saving data, etc to push myself to become better at something I was genuinely interested in. This project also pushed me to try creating art, which today has brought me to a point where I enjoy drawing and studying human anatomy.

Currently implemented:
1) 2D Player controller; Tap on a level in the current map and the selected character will auto path to that location.
2) 

Current State:

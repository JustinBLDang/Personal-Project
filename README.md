# Personal-Project
A little incomplete game that was initially inspired by This War of Mine and Fallout Shelter on the IOS.

This was my very first coding project which started in 2019. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to set small goals such as getting a character to move, saving data, etc to push myself to become better at something I was genuinely interested in. This project also pushed me to try creating art, which today has brought me to a point where I enjoy drawing and studying human anatomy.

I have many plans laid out for this project, on Microsoft OneNote, for what I want to do next and am excited to find time to continue accomplishing these little goals I set for myself. I think about this project often, but regretably don't work on it often due to the time I need to dedicate to college in order to perform well. But regardless of this, this project remains as something I can look forward to once I graduate from college. 

Current State:

# Personal-Project
A little incomplete game that was initially inspired by This War of Mine and Fallout Shelter on the IOS.

This was my very first coding project which started in 2019. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to set small goals such as getting a character to move, saving data, etc to push myself to become better at something I was genuinely interested in. This project also pushed me to try creating art, which today has brought me to a point where I enjoy drawing and studying human anatomy.

<strong>Currently implemented:</strong>
1) <strong>2D Camera Controller</strong>; Allows the player to move the camera similar to Fallout Shelter with 1 finger. Player can zoom in and out using 2 fingers. 

2) <strong>2D Player controller</strong>; Tap on a level in the current map and the selected character will auto path to that location.

3) <strong>2D Shader for character selection</strong>; Morphs to character sprite and creates an outline which can have the outline thickness and color adjusted

4) <strong>2D Construction System</strong>; Supports 3 types of rooms: Large, medium, and small

5) <strong>Room Object</strong>; Using Scriptable Objects, I created a template for a room Object that contains all the information necessary for its' instantiation, function, and   appearance.

6) <strong>Level Construction tools</strong>; To build future levels, I created a simple system that allows me to create extremely flexible designs to allow me to design levels as long as rooms remain in the same rectangular shape.


Current State:

# Personal-Project

<strong>Currently implemented:</strong>
1) <strong>2D Camera Controller</strong>; Allows the player to move the camera with 1 finger. Player can zoom in and out using 2 fingers. 

2) <strong>2D Player controller</strong>; Tap on a level in the current map and the selected character will auto path to that location.

3) <strong>2D Construction System</strong>; Opens a menu containing any Room Object I create, allows player to place them in designated spots

4) <strong>Level Construction tools</strong>; Game automatically sets up level using layers and tags. All I have to do is place rooms in any position and tag the gameObject to allow players to move between rooms.


Current State:
